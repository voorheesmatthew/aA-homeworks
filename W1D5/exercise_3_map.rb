# As you saw in the videos for tonight, a map can be implemented using a 2D array. Let's write a Map class (following a similar pattern to Stack and Queue) that implements a map using only arrays.
#
# Remember, a map stores information in key-value pairs, where the keys are always unique. When implemented with arrays, a map might look something like this: my_map = [[k1, v1], [k2, v2], [k3, v2], ...].
#
# Our Map class should have the following instance methods: set(key, value), get(key), delete(key), show. Note that the set method can be used to either create a new key-value pair or update the value for a pre-existing key. It's up to you to check whether a key currently exists!
#
# As always, test your code thoroughly to make sure all properties of maps are enforced.

class Map

  def set(key, value)
    
  end

  def get(key)

  end

  def delete_key

  end

  def show

  end

end
